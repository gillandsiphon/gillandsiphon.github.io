### Working on a Visual Explainer

I recently used Claude to help me write a blog post I've been planning for a while and found iterative diagramming productive and enjoyable.

The post I wrote is a short primer for the word association game *Codenames*. I've often found the need for a concise explainer that's separate from a rulebookâ€”the goal is to familiarize someone with what Codenames is rather than how to play it.

As *Codenames* is a visual game with color-coded cards and hidden information, representing concepts with diagrams is a natural choice. 

### Examples, To Start

All visuals in the short primer were generated through Claude. For context, I'll display a few examples here (including some that were left on the cutting room floor).

### Before Artifacts

#### Traditional Image Editing



### Output

Claude Artifacts make generating and iterating on diagrams mostly delightful. Diagrams were generated in HTML and CSS, but were saved by me as pngs.
