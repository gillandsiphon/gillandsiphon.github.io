I recently used Claude to help me write a blog post I've been planning for a while and came across a helpful use case: diagramming. 

The post I wrote is a short primer for the word association game *Codenames*. I've often found the need for a concise explainer that's separate from a rulebookâ€”the goal is to familiarize someone with *what Codenames is* rather than *how to play it*.

As *Codenames* is a relatively visual game, with color-coded elements and hidden information, representing concepts with diagrams is a natural choice.
