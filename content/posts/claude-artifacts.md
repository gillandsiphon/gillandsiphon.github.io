## Working on a Visual Explainer

I recently used Claude to help me write a blog post I've been planning for a while and found iterative diagramming productive and enjoyable.

The post I wrote is [a short primer for the word association game *Codenames*](../codenames-primer/). I've often found the need for a concise explainer that's separate from a rulebookâ€”the goal is to familiarize someone with what *Codenames* is rather than how to play it.

As *Codenames* is a visual game with color-coded cards and hidden information, representing concepts with diagrams is a natural choice. 

## Thoughts on Artifacts

In my experience, image editing software for creating diagrams like these works best when you've already finished brainstorming. It's possible to make adjustments during the creation process, but as the complexity of the diagrams grow, it becomes harder to pivot towards new ideas and directions. 

Models like Claude act like something between a [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) and an immediate feedback loop. I've found they facilitate the brainstorming process, maybe even mostly by forcing the user to articulate their vision, and potentially offer immediate feedback that makes taking a further step actionable.

Anthropic's Artifacts really tightens the immediate feedback loop by rendering the HTML/CSS in a dedicated window alongside the text chat. You see output *as* you brainstorm, and I found it easy to land on a viable design for an instructional diagram working iteratively with Claude.
