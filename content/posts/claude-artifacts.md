### Working on a Visual Explainer

I recently used Claude to help me write a blog post I've been planning for a while and found iterative diagramming productive and enjoyable.

The post I wrote is [a short primer for the word association game *Codenames*]((../codenames-primer/)). I've often found the need for a concise explainer that's separate from a rulebookâ€”the goal is to familiarize someone with what Codenames is rather than how to play it.

As *Codenames* is a visual game with color-coded cards and hidden information, representing concepts with diagrams is a natural choice. 

### Examples, To Start

All visuals in the [primer]((../codenames-primer/))were generated through Claude. Diagrams were generated in HTML and CSS, but were manually saved as pngs.  For context, I'll display two examples here (one that was left on the cutting room floor).

##### Win Condition
!["test6"](/img/example27.png)

##### Game Flow
!["test13"](/img/example13.png)






### Output

Claude Artifacts make generating and iterating on diagrams mostly delightful. Diagrams were generated in HTML and CSS, but were saved by me as pngs.
