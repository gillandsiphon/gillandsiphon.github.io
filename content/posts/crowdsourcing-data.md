### Task Definition

To start exploring how models perform on a word association problem, I've defined a simple task: 

!["word1"](/img/word1.png)

Task: Given a clueword and four board words, select the two target words of the four board words that relate to the clue. Selections are made one word at a time. The task ends when either an unrelated word is selected, or both target words are chosen.
