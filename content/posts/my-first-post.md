*Scattergories* is a word association game that's better demonstrated than explained: 

If you had to think of *one* word that starts with "C" and relates to food, what would it be?
- Did you think of "Cabbage"?
- Or did you land on "Cauliflower"?
- Or some kind of "Chip"?

In *Scattergories*, players enumerate words that begin with a specified letter, within a category.
