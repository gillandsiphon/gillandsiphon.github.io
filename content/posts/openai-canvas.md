# Canvas 

OpenAI released Canvas in beta this week, which is a new interface that allows collaborative, iterative work with ChatGPT. It's currently geared towards writing and codingâ€”the model will open a dedicated, editable pane with a few options geared towards the kind of work it detects. I casually explored both the writing and coding workflows tonight and have garnered some first impressions and feedback.

# Claude's Artifacts

This release is, for me, serendipitious, as I've recently been exploring Anthropic's Artifacts, which is a pretty similar feature: a dedicated pane opens up when Claude detects something artifact-able, fit for iterative work. However, Artifacts and Canvas have different strengths that make using them feel very different.

# Iterative Diagramming

My choice of exercise to explore Canvas' code editing ability is admittedly kind of unfair.

I've explored [Claude Artifacts](https://gillandsiphon.github.io/posts/claude-artifacts/) for iteratively creating explanatory diagrams in HTML and CSS. Artifacts has the ability to render code, which makes iterating on diagrams possible in the UI. To approximate this result in Canvas, which currently does not render displays, I copy-pasted the HTML each iteration and manually rendered it. I'll do my best to decouple this manual friction from my overview of Canvas. 

## Code

Asking *ChatGPT 4o with canvas* to generate code generally will trigger an inline code pane that can be expanded into the Canvas panel beside the chat UI. The panel displays line numbers, and contains syntax-highlighted code that is, most importantly editable.

I have a detailed, stream-of-consciousness account of my attempt at iterative diagramming with Canvas [here](https://gillandsiphon.github.io/posts/chatgpt-canvas/), but the gist of is that I lobbed it with iterative requests to generate HTML. I used the exercise as a way to understand what kind of collaboration works for code in Canvas. Although I don't think I cracked the code here, I think I did surface some initial strengths and limitations.

### Strengths

#### Editability

I rarely used editablity in my process generating HTML with Canvas, and I now recnogize it's not the kind of task that necessitates notebook-like editing. But despite that, editability is a big deal: if I want to change elements in the code I can just do them painlessly inline instead of wasting tokens going through a prompt and regen or manually making edits in an editor while moving outside the UI.

##### Artifacts

Artifacts currently doesn't have editability, and I did run into the above problems (wasting tokens, manually editing) if I needed to make small edits in code.

#### Branching

Collaboration is by nature iterative, and iteration can take you down rabbit holes, some of which you might want to backtrack from. Canvas offers a 'Previous Version' arrow topping the Canvas panel. Clicking it allows you to toggle through versions and restore a previous one.

##### Artifacts

 Artifacts has [several options](https://gillandsiphon.github.io/posts/claude-artifacts/#branching) for branching, rerolling, or visiting previous versions.
