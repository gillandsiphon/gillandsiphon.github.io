I am currently crowdsourcing data to evaluate model performance on a clue generation task. Details of the task are outlined in some detail [here](), but in short: I designed clue generation tasks and had five LLMs, as well as one human (me), generate clues for each task. I built and deployed a site that will present participants tasks and record participant guesses. The goal is to evaluate model clue-giving performance on this task.
