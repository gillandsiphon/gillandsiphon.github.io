I got back preliminary data from my word association task.

I received 499 responses. 41 unique users visited.
I removed incomplete question instances.

Most users did not answer many questions. Should I remove those users who answered less than 5 questions?
doing this i have 30 users.

The dataset has 10 questions per model.
