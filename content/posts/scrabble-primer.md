The purpose of this article is to introduce the broad strokes of the board game *Scrabble* as context for later posts.

## Basic Mechanics

*Scrabble* is a wordbuilding game played with 1-4 players. 

### Board

The board displays a grid with a marked center position. Players are distributed random letter tiles.

### Wordbuilding

#### First Turn

The first turn begins with a player forming a word from their letter tiles. The first word must be placed horizontally or vertically such that one of the tiles takes the center position.

#### Subsequent Turns

Players then alternate turns, building words by laying their own tiles with existing board tiles, horizontally or vertically.

#### Drawing More Tiles

Turns end by players redrawing tiles to replenish their hand.

### Points

Each letter is labeled with a point value.

Players calculate point totals for each word they successfully build and keep track of accrued total.

### Premium Tiles

Some of the cells on the board grid are colored. These cells have properties such as multiplying letter scores or word scores. Players are incentivized to use them to accrue more points.
